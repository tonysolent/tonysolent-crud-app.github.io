Introduction
Our project aims to create a full-stack JavaScript application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. The inspiration for this project came from the need for a simple and intuitive way to manage a database of items, such as products or articles.
System Overview
The system consists of a Node.js server that connects to a MongoDB database and serves a simple HTML page with JavaScript frontend. The server is built using the Express framework and the MongoDB connection is established using the Mongoose library.
The HTML page displays a list of items in the database and allows the user to add, edit, or delete items. The frontend communicates with the server using AJAX requests and the server performs the CRUD operations on the database. 
The system has the following key components:
•	MongoDB database: Stores the items in a collection.
•	Node.js server: Connects to the database and serves the HTML page with the frontend.
•	HTML page: Displays the list of items and provides the interface for performing CRUD operations.
•	JavaScript frontend: Makes AJAX requests to the server to perform the CRUD operations.
Key Design Decisions
Database Design
We chose to use MongoDB for the database because it is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing flexible, unstructured data. We created a single collection called "items" to store the items in the database. Each item has the following fields:
•	name: The name of the item.
•	description: A description of the item.
•	price: The price of the item.
Security and Scalability
To ensure the security of the application, we implemented the following measures:
•	We used the MongoDB driver's built-in support for connection pooling to prevent connection exhaustion attacks.
•	We used the body-parser middleware to parse the request bodies and protect against body parsing attacks.
To ensure the scalability of the application, we implemented the following measures:
•	We used the MongoDB driver's built-in support for connection pooling to allow the server to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
•	We used the cluster module in Node.js to create a cluster of worker processes, which allows the server to take advantage of multi-core systems and improve performance.
Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
•	Node.js
•	MongoDB
Step 1: Set up the project
Create a new directory for the project and navigate to it:
mkdir crud-app cd crud-app 
Next, initialize the project with npm and create the package.json file:
npm init -y 
Step 2: Install the dependencies
Next, install the required dependencies. We will be using the following packages:
•	express: A web framework for Node.js
•	mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment
•	body-parser: A middleware to parse request bodies
To install these dependencies, run the following command:
npm install express mongoose body-parser 
Step 3: Set up the database
Next, we need to set up the database. Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.
In your project directory, create a new file called db.js and add the following code to it:
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); // Connect to the database mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/crud-app', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }); const db = mongoose.connection; // Handle any errors db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:')); // Once the connection is open, we can start performing CRUD operations db.once('open', function() { console.log('Connected to the database!'); }); 
This code connects to a MongoDB database called crud-app running on the local machine. If the connection is successful, it will print a message to the console.
Step 4: Set up the server
Next, we will set up the server. In the project directory, create a new file called server.js and add the following code to it:
const express = require('express'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const db = require('./db'); // The database connection const app = express(); // Parse request bodies as JSON app.use(bodyParser.json()); // Set up the routes // The root route returns a list of all items in the database app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send('Hello World!'); }); // Start the server const port = 3000; app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); }); 
This code sets up a simple Express server that listens on port 3000 and returns "Hello World!" when the root route is accessed.
Step 5: Define the data model
Next, we need to define a data model for the items we want to store in the database.
Create a new file called item.js and add the following code to it:
``
  
Step 5: Define the data model
Next, we need to define a data model for the items we want to store in the database.
Create a new file called item.js and add the following code to it:
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); const itemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, description: String, price: Number }); module.exports = mongoose.model('Item', itemSchema); 
This code defines a simple schema for items with a name, description, and price.
Step 6: Set up the routes
Next, we will set up the routes for the CRUD operations.
In server.js, import the Item model and add the following routes:
const express = require('express'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const db = require('./db'); // The database connection const Item = require('./item'); // The item model const app = express(); // Parse request bodies as JSON app.use(bodyParser.json()); // Set up the routes // The root route returns a list of all items in the database app.get('/', (req, res) => { Item.find({}, (err, items) => { if (err) { res.send(err); } else { res.json(items); } }); }); // The create route adds a new item to the database app.post('/create', (req, res) => { const item = new Item({ name: req.body.name, description: req.body.description, price: req.body.price }); item.save((err, item) => { if (err) { res.send(err); } else { res.json(item); } }); }); // The update route updates an existing item in the database app.put('/update/:id', (req, res) => { Item.findByIdAndUpdate( req.params.id, { name: req.body.name, description: req.body.description, price: req.body.price }, (err, item) => { if (err) { res.send(err); } else { res.json(item); } } ); }); // The delete route removes an item from the database app.delete('/delete/:id', (req, res) => { Item.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id, (err, item) => { if (err) { res.send(err); } else { res.json(item); } }); }); // Start the server const port = 3000; app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); }); 
This code sets up routes for the four CRUD operations:
•	GET /: Returns a list
  
Step 7: Test the application
To test the application, start the server by running the following command:
node server.js 
The server should start and you should see the message "Server listening on port 3000".
You can test the different routes using a tool like Postman.
For example, you can send a POST request to the /create route to create a new item:
{ "name": "Item 1", "description": "This is the first item", "price": 10 } 
You should get a response with the newly created item. You can also send a GET request to the root route to get a list of all items in the database.
